# NiceHash Mobile Dev - Job Enterview Test
**This is the application I made to pass NiceHash's Android Developer Job Interview.**

To make this project I used the latest version of Android Studio for Windows 11, using the Kotlin compiler version 1.9.0.
I spent around 7h on this project and started from an app template project provided by Android Studio.

*Note: I've included the test files used together with the app, and also a screen recording of the app's behaviour to the tests below.*

## Answer Test 1:
The accumulator is 1087

## Answer Test 2:
247 passports are valid when cid is optional. The mutlithreaded solution has an identically short duration of execution to single thread since the size of the task is quite small. For larger tasks, or when the overhead of method trace recording in the profiler is enabled, I see a 3-4x speedup from using 4 threads.
